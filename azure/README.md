# Azure - Cloud Infrastructure

This setup is to allow automated provisioning of the ACM@UIC's cloud services.  The main goal of this project is to maintain and deploy the majority of our infrastructure with minimal setup.

The idea is to define Infrastructure as Code (IAC). This allows DevOps and SysAdmin Engineers to easily understand configuration in a uniform way.

## Requirements

* CI/CD Platform (GitHub Actions)
