# Proxmox - Zero to Hero Setup

This setup is to allow automated provisioning of the ACM@UIC's on-prem services.  The main goal of this project is to allow for the automated provisioning of the majority of our infrastructure with minimal setup.

Obviously, since we're dealing with physical servers, there is still some setup to be done in order for this setup to work.

## Requirements

* Basic Networking (DHCP, DNS, Subnets) should be configured prior to this setup
* Provisioning computer on the network
* Hypervisor available for VM workloads
